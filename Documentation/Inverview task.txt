Create a simple web app for managing personal contacts

Required data:
	- first name
	- surname
	- D.O.B
	- address
	- phone number
	- IBAN

The data must be persisted.

There are a few additional paradigms/technologies/techniques we are interested to see:
	- .NET Backend:
	- EF Core for db communication (any db)
	- FluentValidation for models & entities
	- CQRS pattern
	- Rich Domain Model

Angular frontend:
	- ngrx Store
	- PrimeNG components
	- cypress e2e test (1 is enough)
	
Notes by the developer:
    - CQRS is not needed (unnecessary complexity)
        - The command part of this pattern is used for complex processes. The traditional RESTful API approach is perfect for CRUD opperations
        - Check [this](https://github.com/nipolo/invelop-contact-manager/tree/feature/replace-domain-services-with-MediatR) branch for implementation with MediatR library instead of domain services
    - Rich domain models are not needed (unnecessary complexity)
    - Create, Load and Update methods/functions do not accept commands and states as params because the domain objects should be isolated from data and transport/presentation layers
    - Mappers have been avoided for a reason
